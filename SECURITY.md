### Reporting a Vulnerability

We use **GitHub Security Advisories** to manage vulnerability reports. 
If you find a security bug, please:
1. Go to the **"Security"** tab of this repository.
2. Click on **"Advisories"** and then **"Report a vulnerability"**.
3. Provide details and steps to reproduce. 

This keeps the report private while we work on a fix. 
**Please do not open a public Issue for security flaws.**
